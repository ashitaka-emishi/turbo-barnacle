# turbo-barnacle
This is an attempt to structure my knowledge base and metaphysical
representation of reality.

## Why turbo-barnacle?
Github always suggests random project name so I choose the first one that
appeals to me

## Quickstart

# Lint JS files
yarn lint

# Lint sass files
yarn sasslint

# Run Jest tests

```
